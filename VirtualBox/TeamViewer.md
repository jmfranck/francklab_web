We have set up two [VirtualBox]({{ site.url }}/VirtualBox.html) VMs (one Linux, one Windows) that the workshop attendees can install on their laptops in order to follow along with the presentations.

We are asking for your help to get your software installed onto these VMs.  An instance of each is running on a computer in our lab and connected to the web via TeamViewer.  Once everyone has installed their software, we will package up the VMs and make them available for download by the participants.
(See [the Software Packages page]({{site.baseurl}}/Software_Packages.html) for more info.)

### Please follow these instructions to install your software:

1. If you don't have it, please download and install [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/){:target="_blank"}
1. We emailed you the information that you need to connect to the appropriate VM.
    * The partner ID that we sent is specific to the Linux VM or the Windows VM.
    * Currently, Matlab is only installed on the Linux version.  If your software will *only* run on Matlab for Windows, please let us know.
1. Log in with the partner id and password that we sent you.
    * The *password* is the same as the root/admin password.
    * The desktop that you see is a VM.  We will package and distribute this desktop to all participants.
1. When you are logged in you should find a text editor window open.  Please simply type the time (Eastern Daylight -- shown on the desktop) that you log in.  Save the file, but *please do not close the editor window*.
    * Note that people can simultaneously connect to the TeamViewer session, and this log also lets you make sure that no one else is currently using the session.
    * If the mouse is moving "on it's own" someone else is using the session â†’ Please try back later
1. Install your software as normal.
    * The LabVIEW SPI (Windows), Matlab (Linux), and EasySpin (Linux) were installed when the VM was set up.
    * Firefox (and ssh, etc.) should work as normal, allowing you to download your software onto the machine.  If you install any additional software, please note it in the text editor.
1. As you install, please take this as an opportunity to **format installation instructions for those who want to install the software directly on their computer**.  Please email this to the address below. (Please email source documents, not PDFs)
1. Be sure to run the software that you will want to demonstrate during the workshop.
1. Again, please take the opportunity to document a **basic test example** that users can use *merely to insure that the software is working*.
    * This so that they can check an installation.  If they choose to install the software [on their own desktop]({{site.baseurl}}/Software_Packages.html).
1. Type the time that you finish into the text editor window.  Save the file, but *please do not close the editor window*.
