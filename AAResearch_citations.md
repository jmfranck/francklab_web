## Initial examples:
As a fundamental example,
    we looked at lipid bilayers
    -- structures that make up cell membranes.
We developed (at other institutions) a specialized technique to
    characterize water near the bilayer surfaces.
Our technique
    -- called Overhauser Effect Dynamic Nuclear
    Polarization (ODNP) [@FranckPNMRS] --
    tracks the motion of the water nuclei,
    and allows us to zoom in on the
    "hydration water" near the surface of the lipid bilayer
    (figure below).
It allowed us to
    see that the hydration water moves about 5
    times slower than bulk water [@Franck_crowding].
Furthermore, by dramatically
    changing the characteristics of the bulk
    solution,
    we learned that
    an order of magnitude change in the viscosity
    barely affects the diffusion in the hydration
    layer [@Franck_crowding].
We have also implemented this technique
    in systems with membrane proteins [@Hussain2013],
    DNA [@Franck2015DNA],
    and large protein folding chaperones [@FranckGroES].
The significant variations in the properties of the
    hydration water play in important role in how these surfaces
    interact in nature.

*This image illustrates ODNP of water in the hydration layer of a
    lipid bilayer.
This is one example of many studies that are possible with ODNP.
A lipid bilayer (the basis for cellular membranes) consists of a
    self-organized set of molecules with hydrophilic headgroups
    and hydrophobic tails (see labels above).
One can place a spin label (typically a nitroxide group)
    at a particular location near the surface of the lipid
    bilayer (via chemical synthesis).
A combination of electron- and nuclear-spin resonance
    (i.e. ODNP)
    can selectively interrogate the motion of water molecules
    at a specific location --
    here inside the hydration layer of
    the lipid bilayer.
For example, employing the setup shown above,
    we were able to verify that the motion of water molecules
    within the hydration layer was not sensitive to the presence
    of a high concentration of large molecules
    that are not chemically disposed to disrupt the hydration layer.
This was even true when the large molecules significantly altered the
    viscosity of the bulk solution [@Franck_crowding].*

## The future:
In the Franck lab,
    we will extend the power
    of ODNP-based techniques and integrate them with a toolbox of
    previously developed techniques, for example:
    NMR techniques that can measure
    microscopic diffusion and flow,
    as well as electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques that interrogate local
    motions (cw ESR),
    that measure nanometer-scale distances (double
    electron-electron resonance, i.e. "DEER”)
    and that map out local arrangements of nuclei
    (electron-nuclear double resonance, *i.e.* "ENDOR" and electron spin echo
    envelope modulation, i.e. "ESEEM” [@FranckGroES]).
Towards these ends,
    we will draw on expertise in spectrometer design
    [@FranckBarnes2015;@Kaufmann2013;@Demas2009]
    and advanced magnetic resonance methods
    [@FranckFreed2015;@Franck2009].
We will also apply techniques that we have already developed to
    systems that remain poorly understood,
    despite their central importance
    to understanding
    materials function or to understanding disease.
For example, *the Ras protein system* is integral to cell signal
    pathways and the development of novel cancer drugs,
    *polymer electrolyte membranes* are essential to ion transport
    in H~2~/O~2~- and methanol-based fuel cells
    -- as well as sensor devices,
    while biological light-harvesting systems, such as
    *Photosystem II*,
    are believed to integrate nanoscale water channels to aid in
    their function.
Nonetheless, the interplay between all these systems and water has yet to be
    fully explored.

***The Franck lab is looking for interested graduate students and
    undergraduate researchers in Fall 2016***,
    and welcomes any inquiries.
    (feel free to contact Dr. Franck by email).
Students in the Franck lab will
    have the opportunity to work with
    materials or biological systems.
In addition,
    they will gain expertise
    developing new
    spectroscopic methods
    using physics, electronics,
    and computer programming.
Students who capitalize on these opportunities will have a unique
    and powerful skill-set.
