{% include JB/setup %}

If you have not done so, please [install VirtualBox]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox.html) immediately,
followed by *both* the Linux and Windows VM Image, which is now available is now available for [download (click here)]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox/Downloads.html).

A couple points of clarification that have come up:

- The "host" is the computer you are running on -- so if you have a Windows laptop, you download the program for a Windows host.
- The "guest" is the operating system that is running inside the VM.
    - Note that we strongly recommend downloading both images, to be safe.  However, if you do have Matlab installed on a Windows laptop, you in principle do not need to download the VM if you successfully install MMM, the LabVIEW ESR programs (note, LabVIEW license not needed), and the NLSL development code (dependencies already posted, we will post the rest of this today).

We are happy to announce that the first downloaders gave very useful feedback, and we can confirm that the distribution is now going well.
