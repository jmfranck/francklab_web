### Check on June 5<sup>th</sup> for software download! ###

Due to the fact that many presenters are actively developing their contribution to the workshop, we plan on releasing the pre-installed software packages (VMs) by **June 5<sup>th</sup>**.
Please [install VirtualBox]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox.html) immediately and plan on checking back on **June 5<sup>th</sup>** to download the software before arriving.

### Computer Requirements ###

If you are unable to bring a laptop running a 64bit operating system to the symposium, you need to **please, inform us now!!**

***Unfortuantely, the VM software will require at least 30 Gb of hard drive space to install,*** so please ensure that you have this space on your laptop.  We additionally encourage all participants to install both VM environments before arriving -- even if they are only intended as a backup option.

### Information on Workshop Software ###

There will be two ways to participate in the workshops:

* Preferred: **Install on Personal Laptop**:
    On the links above, you should find instructions for installing the various [software packages]({{site.baseurl}}/Software_Packages.html) on your personal laptop, so that you can use the various software packages both during and after the conference.
    However, you will typically *not be able to install all the software onto your laptop desktop environment*, since some software only runs on Windows while other software runs only under Linux or Mac.
* **VirtualMachine**:
    We will be supplying [VirtualMachines]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox.html) (VMs) which can run on any 64-bit operating system and will have the various software packages pre-installed.
    These will emulate:
    * **Windows**, which is preinstalled with
        - [X] Dr. Altenbach's LabVIEW packages
        - [ ] NLSL
    * **Linux**, which is preinstalled with
        - [X] EasySpin
        - [X] Spinach
        - [*under development*] NLSL
        - [X] Matlab
        - [*under development*] Prof. Fajer's Matlab Package
        - [*under development*] SALEM
        - [ ] ORCA
