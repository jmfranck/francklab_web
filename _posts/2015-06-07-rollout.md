{% include JB/setup %}

If you have not done so, please [install VirtualBox]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox.html) immediately,
followed by the Linux VM Image, which is now available is now available for [download (click here)]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox/Downloads.html).

We are happy to announce that the first downloaders gave very useful feedback, and we can confirm that the distribution is now going well.

The Windows VM Image will be available later this evening -- since it takes time to download, we truly hope everyone will download and install the Linux VM first.

We are expecting that everyone will come to the workshop with both the Windows and Linux VMs running and able to open Matlab.
There will unfortunately not be time to resolve issues during the workshop, so don't hesitate to **contact us now**.
