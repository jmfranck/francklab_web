There will be two ways to participate in the workshops:

* Preferred: **Install on Personal Laptop**:
    On the links above, you should find instructions for installing the various [software packages]({{site.baseurl}}/Software_Packages.html) on your personal laptop, so that you can use the various software packages both during and after the conference.
* **VirtualMachine**:
    Unfortunately, the Operating Systems supported by the various software packages are mutually exclusive.
    Therefore, we will be supplying [VirtualMachines]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox.html) (VMs) which can run on any 64-bit operating system and will have the various software packages pre-installed.
    These will emulate:
    * **Windows**, which is preinstalled with
        - [/] Dr. Altenbach's LabVIEW packages *(only MultiComponent currently installed)*
        - [ ] NLSL
    * **Linux**, which is preinstalled with
        - [X] EasySpin
        - [ ] Spinach
        - [ ] NLSL
        - [X] Matlab
        - [ ] Prof. Fajer's Matlab Package
        - [ ] SALEM
        - [ ] ORCA

***Unfortuantely, the VM software will require at least 30 Gb of hard drive space to install,*** so please ensure that you have this space on your laptop.  We additionally encourage all participants to install both VM environments before arriving -- even if they are only intended as a backup option.
