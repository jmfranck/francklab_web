Students in the Franck lab have the opportunity to learn
    and demonstrate experience in 
    a wide range of skills applicable to their future careers,
    in fact a broader range of opportunities than in a more
    traditional chemistry lab:
    ranging from the engineering of new spectrometer software,
    to the development of customized [software](Software.html),
    to biochemical expression methods.

Students joining the Franck lab will
    have the opportunity to work with
    a unique combination of state-of-the-art instruments,
    as well as customized tools
    available nowhere else in the world.

Incoming students with an interest in
    spectroscopy,
    chemical physics,
    biochemistry,
    chemical synthesis,
    or
    analytical chemistry
    are particularly encouraged to investigate the Franck lab
    further.
