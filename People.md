## John M. Franck

John completed his PhD thesis under the guidance of
Prof. Alex Pines at Berkeley, studying sophisticated
methods of NMR pulse design and the development of
portable and transportable NMR instruments.
He worked as an Elings Prize Postdoctoral Fellow
(California NanoSystems Institute)
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
under the guidance of Prof. Songi Han.
Here, he developed new, sensitive technologies for investigating
the properties of water at the surfaces of proteins,
polymers, lipids, and DNA.
He completed further postdoctor studies and served as a
research associate at the Advanced Center for ESR
Technology (ACERT) at Cornell University,
under the guidance of Prof. Jack Freed.
There, he participated in studies that advanced the
forefront of high-field high-frequency pulse ESR;
techniques that provide detailed dynamic
characterizations of proteins and other biomolecular
systems.
These technologies are challenged only by difficulties
with probing samples that generated short-lived signal;
while at ACERT Prof. Franck pioneered
studies that enabled detection of shorter-lived species than could
be proved previously.
After beginning his position at Syracuse University,
the laboratory was opened in the summer of 2017.
Already, talented graduate students and undergraduate
researchers have begun to make vigorous contributions.
