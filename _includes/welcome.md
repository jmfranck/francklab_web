Research in the Franck lab is highly interdisciplinary, but also
extremely accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds. We
employ a mix of chemical physics, biochemistry, analytical chemistry,
and synthetic tools in order to develop unorthodox spectroscopic
techniques that investigate how water interacts with the surfaces of
proteins and soft materials.

Even though water appears uniform on a macroscopic scale, it behaves
quite differently on the nanoscale. If we zoom in to the first few
layers of water molecules near a surface, we see that hydrogen bonds
break and individual water molecules move at rates anywhere from a
couple times slower to hundreds of times slower than those in the bulk
liquid. In both biomolecules and synthetic materials, we know that these
differently behaved "hydration waters" are key to determining
interactions. The layer of water surrounding oil molecules that drive
the separation of water and oil are the simplest example of hydration
water, but the more general case, especially for macromolecules that
present a surface with variable properties to the solvent, is far more
interesting.

Our goal:
---------

Since comprehensive methods for mapping out the structure of the
hydration layer do not currently exist, the acquisition of this
information is crucial to the future development of the chemistry of
macromolecules. The resulting insight will improve our ability to design
drugs and synthetic materials. In particular, we specialize in magnetic
resonance techniques that communicate with both electron and nuclear
spins to probe nanometer-scale structure and dynamics.

For example, proteins are the molecular motors that drive all life, and
most drugs are designed to interact with proteins. It is increasingly
clear that water molecules at the surface of proteins control their
structure and function; while researchers have developed methods that
can study the structure of proteins, there are no accessible methods to
spatially map the hydration water. Similarly, researchers have
identified a direct link between the behavior of hydration water
associated with synthetic materials and the properties of those
materials. We develop and apply magnetic-resonance-based spectroscopic
methods for routine, robust, and accessible measurements of the
properties of these key hydration water molecules.

Why hydration water?
--------------------

While tools have been developed for characterizing static structures, we
still need techniques that can study dynamic arrangements of molecules
and, most urgently, the arrangement of water molecules.

General
-------

Our work relies on a simple chemical labeling strategy:

Students in the Franck lab have the opportunity to learn and demonstrate
experience in a wide range of skills applicable to their future careers,
... in fact a broader range of opportunities than in a more traditional
chemistry lab.

Students joining the Franck lab will have the opportunity to work with a
unique combination of state-of-the-art instruments, as well as
customized tools available nowhere else in the world.

Incoming students with an interest in spectroscopy, chemical physics,
biochemistry, chemical synthesis, or analytical chemistry are
particularly encouraged to investigate the Franck lab further.

Initial examples:
-----------------

As a fundamental example, we looked at lipid bilayers -- structures that
make up cell membranes. We developed (at other institutions) a
specialized technique to characterize water near the bilayer surfaces.
Our technique -- called Overhauser Effect Dynamic Nuclear Polarization
(ODNP)<sup>1</sup> -- tracks the motion of the water nuclei, and allows us to
zoom in on the "hydration water" near the surface of the lipid bilayer
(figure below). It allowed us to see that the hydration water moves
about 5 times slower than bulk water<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, by dramatically
changing the characteristics of the bulk solution, we learned that an
order of magnitude change in the viscosity barely affects the diffusion
in the hydration layer<sup>2</sup>. We have also implemented this technique in
systems with membrane proteins<sup>3</sup>, DNA<sup>4</sup>, and large protein folding
chaperones<sup>5</sup>. The significant variations in the properties of the
hydration water play in important role in how these surfaces interact in
nature.

*This image illustrates ODNP of water in the hydration layer of a lipid
bilayer. This is one example of many studies that are possible with
ODNP. A lipid bilayer (the basis for cellular membranes) consists of a
self-organized set of molecules with hydrophilic headgroups and
hydrophobic tails (see labels above). One can place a spin label
(typically a nitroxide group) at a particular location near the surface
of the lipid bilayer (via chemical synthesis). A combination of
electron- and nuclear-spin resonance (i.e. ODNP) can selectively
interrogate the motion of water molecules at a specific location -- here
inside the hydration layer of the lipid bilayer. For example, employing
the setup shown above, we were able to verify that the motion of water
molecules within the hydration layer was not sensitive to the presence
of a high concentration of large molecules that are not chemically
disposed to disrupt the hydration layer. This was even true when the
large molecules significantly altered the viscosity of the bulk
solution<sup>2</sup>.*

The future:
-----------

In the Franck lab, we will extend the power of ODNP-based techniques and
integrate them with a toolbox of previously developed techniques, for
example: NMR techniques that can measure microscopic diffusion and flow,
as well as electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques that interrogate
local motions (cw ESR), that measure nanometer-scale distances (double
electron-electron resonance, i.e. "DEER") and that map out local
arrangements of nuclei (electron-nuclear double resonance, *i.e.*
"ENDOR" and electron spin echo envelope modulation, i.e. "ESEEM"<sup>5</sup>).
Towards these ends, we will draw on expertise in spectrometer
design<sup>6--8</sup> and advanced magnetic resonance methods<sup>9,10</sup>. We will also
apply techniques that we have already developed to systems that remain
poorly understood, despite their central importance to understanding
materials function or to understanding disease. For example, *the Ras
protein system* is integral to cell signal pathways and the development
of novel cancer drugs, *polymer electrolyte membranes* are essential to
ion transport in H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>- and methanol-based fuel cells -- as well as
sensor devices, while biological light-harvesting systems, such as
*Photosystem II*, are believed to integrate nanoscale water channels to
aid in their function. Nonetheless, the interplay between all these
systems and water has yet to be fully explored.

***The Franck lab is looking for interested graduate students and
undergraduate researchers in Fall 2016***, and welcomes any inquiries.
(feel free to contact Dr. Franck by email). Students in the Franck lab
will have the opportunity to work with materials or biological systems.
In addition, they will gain expertise developing new spectroscopic
methods using physics, electronics, and computer programming. Students
who capitalize on these opportunities will have a unique and powerful
skill-set.
