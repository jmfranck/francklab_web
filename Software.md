The following are software packages under continuous in-house development.

Students (with no previous experience required)
    have the opportunity to learn programming skills by participating in
    further development and deployment of these packages.

## pySpecData

As our lab develops methods to acquire new types of data,
we need to develop software to process that data.
To simplify the development of data processing software,
we have developed (and continue to actively improve) the pySpecData library.

pySpecData is a object-oriented library for dealing with multi-dimensional data
that automates many aspects of Fourier transformation,
plotting, and error propagation.
It also offers support for generating PDF lab notebooks
from latex files that include
embedded code to processes raw NMR or EPR data.
